Hi! I am Deepesh. I love building cool products and recently got my master's degree in computer
        science from the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Currently, I've been associated with a very cool
        startup which I co-founded with my friends almost 3 years ago called [munevo](https://munevo.com/home_en).
        [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1IKTagPL-4) is a short video of mine explaining what we do. At our startup, I wear different hats of a product manager, software developer,
        analyst, etc. and I love it. Before coming to Munich I had short stints as a software engineer at Samsung
        Research and a startup called Tapzo(acquired by Amazon) and even before that, I was an undergrad in
        Computer science at NIT Silchar, India.
